      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        I will ensure that I provide quality and user-friendly IT solutions to enhance efficiency, communication, and service quality. 
        My vision is to lead by example, facilitate lifelong learning, and develop systems that allow teams and users to have a thoughtful and responsive experience.
      </p> <br>

      <h2>Values and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My view of my IT Supervisor Readiness Web Portfolio was created to help me build a vibrant, engaging professional online profile 
        to showcase my leadership capacity, skills, and flexibility. I planned to emphasize the required skills, equipment, and principles 
        that can be achieved with the help of computers and related software and that are essential in pursuing the profession of a Blockchain Developer in the future, 
        where integrity and decentralization principles and secure transaction processing are core values (Kieu, 2022).
      </p> 

      <p>
        In describing my experience of dealing with KPIs, motivating team members, and sustaining service level agreements and up-time of the systems, 
        I was ready to handle large, distributed systems with mastery and ethical insight.
